			<h1>Happy Little Paragraphs!</h1>
			<p class="five">That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.</p>

			<p class="five">At home you have unlimited time. Let your imagination be your guide. Fluff that up.</p>

			<p class="five otherFour">We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.</p>

			<p class="five otherFour">You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them
				happen. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>

			<p class="five otherFour">Trees cover up a multitude of sins. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you
				can put in it. Go crazy. A beautiful little sunset. What the devil.</p>

			<p class="otherFour">Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Imagination is the key to painting. Let
				the paint work. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a
				snow-covered dinner. Use your imagination, let it go.</p>
			<p id="treeFriend">There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a
			friend.</p>
